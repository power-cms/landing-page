I'm more than happy, that I can finally say: First version of PowerCMS is officially released! 🎉 It took me few months of my after-hours work to finish this first MVP, but it was worth it! What are the features and why should you use it?

<!--truncate-->

### What is the motivation?

Threre are few types of IT projects: very small and short in development, medium-complexity ones with few months development time and finally the large ones planed for year(-s) of development devided into several stages. Small projects almost always don't require advanced architecture, sophisticated solutions or scalable architecure, while the biggest need to be well planed, considering all future plans and possibilities to potential changes, but in case of long term there is time for such a planning.

From my experience those "medium-complexity" projects very often become an MVP of the long term projects. When the client come to the software company he usually asks about a small projecet **"you know, just a simple website, I would like to edit a home page, create a gallery, contact form, have simple chat and handle some business processes"**. Uhm, sounds like a quite typical project, not trivial, will take some time, but not a rocket science. When you deliver the project (taking some technical compromises) then you release it finalizing, then after some time, the client gets back to you asking about new features, because the project was successful. If your application was now written with good practices, if it's not opened for new functionalities, then you have a big problem 😅.

PowerCMS is kind of boilerplate for medium-complexity projects, which part is content management, but also any buisness-specific process. It should be extendable, having fully defined, ready for heavy traffic infrastructure and, at the same time being easy to implement simple features and not overengineered.

### Fundamentals

The fundamentals of PowerCMS are (and always will be): good code quality, maintainability, new technologies and trends. As a programmer it's very important to me, to do my best in every piece of code, because this is what I'm responsible for. I believe that high code quality is our kind of insurance. When you have high test coverage, you made everything according to best practices, then you can feel you made a good job.

### Actual features

As it actuall is an MVP, so there are not a lot of features, but the core ones are included. From the business point of view:

- 🙎‍♂️ User authorization
- 📑 Sites management
- 👨‍👦‍👦 Users management
- ⚙️ Website settings

and from thechnical point of view:

- Microservices architecture
- Many domain packages + one api gateway
- One common package to create others
- React kit for easy front-end building

### Future plans

Even if it's a first release, I have a head full of the plans for features and improvements. Check the Roadmap tab for more informations.
