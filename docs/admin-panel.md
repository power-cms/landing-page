> PowerCMS comes with the Admin Panel, but it's not a part of a main project repository, to let anyone choose if he wants to use this one or write his own.
> Panel is written in React, using PowerCMS [react-kit](react-kit.md) package. It's very clean, simple, and mobile ready.

## How to use?

Clone the repository first

```bash
git clone git@github.com:power-cms/admin-panel.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```
